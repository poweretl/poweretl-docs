			<p>This function is for users to view CSV file formats, but to have each column separated by its Separator Value. The user can upload only a CSV file and its contents will be displayed below. The user will receive an error message if a non CSV file is uploaded. Files uploaded here are only for viewing and do not affect any loading processes, however the user can either download a copy of the CSV file, copy the contents to the clipboard or even print out the details that are displayed.</p>
